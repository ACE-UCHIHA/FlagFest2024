In Draw Math Draw challenge only a PNG file named [broken_qr.png](https://github.com/ACE-UCHIHA/FlagFest2024/blob/main/writeup/Draw%20Math%20Draw/images/broken_qr.png) was given.

![Draw Math Draw broken QR](https://github.com/ACE-UCHIHA/FlagFest2024/blob/main/writeup/Draw%20Math%20Draw/images/broken_qr.png "This was the provided broken QR")

Which was a image of a QR code but with some doodles on it and because of these doodles the QR code was corrupted and couldn't be scanned.


So we need to recreate the Exact QR from scratch or fix it using our ART skills ;)


We used [pixilart.com](https://pixilart.com/draw) for recreating the QR

here's a .pixil file that you can import in that website a see a recreated version of the QR
[fixed_qr.pixil](https://github.com/ACE-UCHIHA/FlagFest2024/blob/main/writeup/Draw%20Math%20Draw/images/fixed_qr.pixil)

After scanning our recreated QR we get a pastebin link https://pastebin.com/1LU6Kjzt

Which says " **_Self-Reference is the key isn't it?_** " and gives us alot of gibberish number stating that's the flag.

here's the content of the pastebin url 

```
 Self-Reference is the key isn't it?
    

 anyways here's the flag=4749213018208329092654417566871950218631663714830909948050110410794128872161939738850463928125422683587434946200389398886254203042228541925380086594693658164989057675305874475271459942048251502791707388022704880600504697005283242673076645797196434201076429298534951824075877110135130727350950496352627723629997658461125093127672299736847395099602302495143557586363495426792588118195113195432735999029104113679291418989675914077422362753091844830996144020826556114305391099544416455782237793701952805648702254287372913472408955070595203080704
```
Now if we see the name of the challenge it says there's something related to Math in here.
So if you research on Math and Self-Reference you'll eventually run into a fomula called "Tupper's self-referential formula". Which can visually represent numbers. 




so we will use this visualizer https://keelyhill.github.io/tuppers-formula/ to visualize the number

and we got the flag
